				*NOSTR TO GOURCE*
		Display nostr events as Gource visualisation.
		
		
Objectif:
Display nostr events for the last hour/24hour:
	- general : show a general map or relays classify by:
	
		GOURCELOG: -> TLD -> Relayname -> Relay.relays
		|> NIPS -> Suppored nip.nipnumber
		
		
	- per pubkey:
		for a specified pubkey, this would show all events published
		by a specific pubkey. classify by:
		GOURCELOG: -> nostr.key/nip05 -> Event type > Relay.com
	- per relay:
		for a specified relay, this would classify events by type.
		It would be nice to have a folder for paid invoices.
	- encrypted message map:
		even tho messages are encrypted, some data is still public.
		in the making of this project, i found intresting that i can
		possibly use gource to visualise this public data. 

MÃ©thodologie:
Using gource isnt hard, making custom log can be painfull but i think,
because we have the proper tools (nostcat), it wont be too hard.



usage:
git clone https://github.com/gourcetools/nostr2gource
cd nostr2gource
./src/dl*

required:
sed awk openssl gource nostcat
